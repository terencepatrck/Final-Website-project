            <div class="mediacontent">This is my main design for the Bristol International Balloon Festival poster. I
                had a difficult time figuring out how I would be able to incorporate the joyous festivity of the balloon
                festival into my poster. But I decided to take the route of putting emphasis on how I can attract
                viewers by using pastel colours or using subtle colours to attract people's eyes to the image in front
                of them. I was inspired by book covers that emphasise the image while the title and smaller text sizes
                around it keep the viewer interested.Â  <br> <br> For my main design and the other three
                poster I have incorporated contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity. I have mostly enjoyed using
                contrast and repetition because it is more jolly to look at, especially for this event to have been
                repeated.
                elements such as the text. and using contrast on this event can never go wrong because it is
                such a colourful event that you can take inspiration from with your colour choices. </div>
